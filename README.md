# Word-Embedding-technique-using-CBOW---Skipgram
The aim of this experiment is to learn and analyze word embeddings from a textual document using neural language models, specifically Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram, by investigating how context window size and embedding dimensionality influence the quality of the learned vector representations.
